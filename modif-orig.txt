The original code was called 'mmm418' and was ported to use camltk418.
Then I ported it to ocaml 3.12 and Mac. It now works!
Ported to ocaml 4.00.1.

Moved arount lots of stuff. Simplified the Makefiles.

Have first to:
 $ cd external/ocamltk
 update site.config CPPFLAGS to find tcl.h
 $ ./configure --with-config=./site.config
 $ make
 $ make install

Then:
 $ make depend # adjust path to ocamltk in some .depend
 $ make


UPDATE 2026:
updated to use dune instead and the official labltk OPAM package.
