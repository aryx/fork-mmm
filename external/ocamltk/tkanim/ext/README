This is very simple Tcl/Tk extention for Animated GIF files.

It add only one command.

	animation create file

This command read an animated gif file specified by file and decode it.
If it succeeds, the result is,

	Result ::= logicalWidth logicalHeight { Frame+ } loop
	Frame ::= {image leftPos topPos delay}

For example, in animwish

% animation create mmm.anim.gif
64 64 {{image1 64 64 0 0 10} {image2 64 64 0 0 10} ... } 0

This means mmm.anim.gif has 64x64 width and height, the first two frames
in mmm.anim.gif has also 64x64 width and height and should be put at (0,0),
and both of them have 10 x 10 msec delay.
  
This library has no commands for displaying animated gif files. All things
should be done in CamlTk !
