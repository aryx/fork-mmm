This directory is a copy of the header files in the ocaml standard
library. This is useful for me when using codemap so that I can see
almost all the code involved in the program. This is also useful for
the pfff emacs tag generator to find the builtins so one can jump easily
to builtins too. Moreover it makes it easy to track new functions
and new core APIs by just diffing with the latest ocaml-3.xxx/stdlib/.

I have removed outcometree.mli because it has a bad license.
I've removed *Labels.mli because it's redundant with unix.mli IMHO.
I've removed parser.mli too.
