PREREQUISITES

You must have already installed
 * Objective Caml 3.04
    ftp://ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light

 * A version of Tcl/Tk, compatible with camltk (Tcl8.3/Tk8.3, ...,
   Tcl7.5/Tk4.1, or Tcl7.6/Tk4.2)
    ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl or various mirrors

 * camltk41 (the library for interfacing Objective Caml to Tcl/Tk) 
   included in the Objective Caml bazar

Also, you need a modern make (gmake is good).

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1- Extract the archive mmm418-src.tar.gz somewhere.
This creates the "mmm418" directory.

2- Configure the system. This is trivial if camltk418 has been installed
properly. In the "mmm418" directory, create your Makefile.config
file by copying Makefile.config.tpl and following the instructions given there.

3- Build the system. From the "mmm418" directory, do:
   make all
   (and make opt to build the native version)
This creates the binary files "mmm.bin", "mmm_remote", "htparse",
"sboard/surfboard", "sboard/surfboard_remote"

4- To be sure everything works well, you can try
   ./mmm.bin

If it fails with error message
./mmm: can't load library 'libtk4.2.so'
or something similar, this means that you must set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
in your shell environment, e.g.
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
% setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib


5- You can now install MMM.
     make install
     (and make installopt to install the native version)

If you want to give a default proxy configuration:
make setup


6- Additional stuff : modules
     cd modules; make
You can copy these modules to your ~/.mmm/418 directory. They will be
automatically loaded when you invoke mmm.
     mkdir -p ~/.mmm/418
     cd modules; cp *.cmo ~/.mmm/418
