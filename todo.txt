* Now

** bugs (tk prototype)

*** ./mmm docs/website/index.html segfault!!!!
file://localhost/home/pad/size.txt

*** bug!!!: why file: events works and http: does not, I have to switch
back and forth to the app to get the events flushed for http
stuff

*** bug: when in file: mode, the link are relative to the pwd
when mmm was run, it should be updated when go in subdirectories,
should use the referer path to generate the right urls

*** About button is wrong

* Later

** gtk/cairo prototype
make a mimimal version, no menus, just rendering of an url?
or goes with tk. It's not that bad actually, if I find
the way to fix the flush event bug.

*** get text/plain working now that I fixed the issue with -linkall

*** try to extract formatter and machine from display/,
should be more tk independent
=> can plug my own formatter backend?

can make the machine and formatter mostly independent of Tk?

try to have format/ independent of tk and display?
htmlfmt.mli, html_form. html_table, attrs?

*** less: try to make class polymorphic? have 'widget at more places?


** stuff in regular browser

*** CSS

*** Javascript

*** M-+ to enlarge the font

*** Tabs

*** Canvas (part of JS)
just redirect to cairo?

** stuff not in current browser

*** expose for tabs!

*** save full history!

** internals

*** remove all those classes?
all those self#xxx, hard to follow responsibilities

deobjectify?
so can be processed by ocaml light :)

*** use threads? can simplify the code?

** misc

look at my todo_browser/
look at servo
