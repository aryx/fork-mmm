<H1>MMM : Technical characteristics</H1>

<H2>Reference documentation, standards</H2>
During the design and development of <B>MMM</B>, we attempted to comply to
the available (or proposed) standards for Web applications. Most of these
standards are
defined in RFCs or recommendations from the 
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">Web Consortium</A>:
<UL>
<LI> HTML 2.0 Proposed standard
(<A HREF="ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1866.txt">rfc 1866</A>)
<LI> HTML 3.2 Reference specification (W3C Recommendation)
<LI> HTTP/1.0 Proposed standard
(<A HREF="ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1945.txt">rfc 1945</A>)
<LI> rfc1630 on Universal Resource Identifiers
(<A HREF="http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1630.txt">rfc 1630</A>)
<LI> rfc1738 on Uniform Resource Locators
(<A HREF="ftp://ds.internic.net//rfc/rfc1738.txt">rfc 1738</A>)
<LI> rfc1808 on Relative URL
(<A HREF="ftp://ds.internic.net//rfc/rfc1808.txt">rfc 1808</A>)
</UL>

<P>
However, the browser is not fully compliant. Some known problems are listed
<A HREF="#compliance"><B>below</B></A>. If you find more problems, please
report them to <A HREF="mailto:Francois.Rouaix@inria.fr">me</A>, giving
</P>

<UL>
<LI> the nature of the problem,
<LI> a relevant reference in one of the documents or some other valuable
material (such as a discussion of the HTML working groups)
<LI> and an URL pointing to a document exhibiting the problem.
</UL>

<H2>Warning</H2>
<P>
<B>MMM</B> is a lot less tolerant than most other browsers. Thus, if
<B>MMM</B> complains about errors in a document, or doesn't display
"correctly" a document according to you, whereas Mozilla or Explorer just
handle it, the culprit is not necessarily <B>MMM</B> : it may be the
document.

Moreover, and I can't repeat this enough:

There. You've been warned. <BR>
And it's slow.<BR>
And it uses heaps of memory.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Please don't complain about tables. I strongly believe there is not proper
way to support tables with the Tk toolkit, as of version 4.{0,1,2}.

<H2>Components</H2>
Architecturally speaking, the browser is formed of several relatively
independent components:
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="#protocols">communication protocols</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#html">HTML viewer</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#viewers">other viewers</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#cache">cache</A>
</UL>


<H2><A NAME="protocols">Protocols</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI> Among the internet protocols used for the Web, <B>MMM</B> implements
only HTTP 1.0. Other protocols are always deferred to the proxy (ftp, wais,
gopher,...). Several requests can be handled simultaneously. Read and writes
on the network are non-blocking, except for DNS interrogations.

<LI> For an HTTP request, the browser first attempts a direct connection to
the server, and in case of failure, redirects the request to the proxy.
The direct connection step never occurs if the browser is configured in mode
<EM>Always Use Proxy</EM>.

<LI> Proxy authentication as proposed in HTTP 1.1 is implemented.

<LI> Vendor specific extensions of HTTP (such as : Refresh, push/pull) are
not supported.

<LI> A request of type <TT>file:</TT> is interpreted as follows: if the host is
"localhost" (<TT>file://localhost/path</TT>), or left unspecified
(<TT>file:///path</TT>), then <EM>path</EM> is considered as an absolute 
path on the local file system. Note: <TT>file:/some/path</TT> is <B>not</B>
a vlid URL, but is accepted for compatibility reason.
<P>
If the host is specified, then the URL is considered as an <TT>ftp:</TT>
URL, and forwarded to the proxy.

<LI> URLS of type <TT>telnet:</TT> are not supported at all.
</UL>


<H2><A NAME="html">HTML Viewer</A></H2>
<B>MMM</B> implements an HTML viewer (documents of type text/html)
conforming to HTML 2.0, and on some points to HTML 3.2. Lexical and
syntactical analysis respect (in principle) the subset of SGML used
in the definition of HTML, and a given DTD (HTML 2.0 or 3.2). Only
SGML minimisation rules are implemented. Syntactical analysis does not
check tag attributes (although the viewer has to check some of them,
obviously).

The capabilities of displaying <EM>in-lined</EM> images are exactly the
capabilities of Tk image loading. Currently, only <TT>GIF</TT>, of
MIME type <TT>image/gif</TT> (except for interlaced GIFS, animated GIFS, and
an approximative treatment of transparent GIFs), <TT>PNM</TT> and
<TT>XBM</TT> images formats are supported. 
More image formats can be supported through Tk extensions (external
dynamically linked libraries). For example support for <TT>PNG</TT> and
<TT>JPEF</TT> (non progressive) can be obtained through libraries.

In recent versions of <B>MMM</B>, animated GIFs are supported with 
additionnal specific code

<H3>Image loading</H3>
There are several modes for image loading, configured in the Preference
panels. Image loading uses an internal queue, with a limit on the maximum
number of simultaneous network connections dedicated to images.

<H2><A NAME="viewers">Other viewers</A></H2>
For other types of document (except <TT>text/plain</TT> for which 
there is also a builtin viewer), <B>MMM</B> calls <TT>metamail</TT>.
A proper configuration of <TT>metamail</TT> (through the <TT>~/.mailcap</TT>
file) can provide viewers for most of document types used on the Web.

<H2><A NAME="cache">Cache</A></H2>
There are two cache levels in <B>MMM</B> : the first level is a graphical
cache, where we keep the displayed version of a document. The second level
is a traditional cache (in memory or on disk), where we keep document
sources (only for text documents).

<H2>Known Bugs</H2>
<DL>

<DT><A NAME="compliance">HTML compliance problems</A>
<DD> The following problems are known:
<UL>

<LI> &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; is not parsed properly. To my knowledge, none of the
main browsers actually parse <TT>DOCTYPE</TT>.

<LI> &lt;! gabuzomeu &gt; is displayed as text (in any case, this is not
a well-formed comment)

<LI> management of spaces might not be always correct.

<LI> ALIGN in &lt;IMG&gt; is not conformant (in particular, in HTML
3.2, the text should wrap around images. Tk doesn't allow this).

<LI> The <TT>background</TT> attribute of <TT>BODY</TT> is not handled.

<LI> The <TT>width</TT> attribute of <TT>PRE</TT> is not handled.

<LI> The <TT>enctype</TT> attribute of  <TT>FORM</TT> is always equal to
<TT>applications/x-www-form-urlencoded</TT>.

<LI> The <TT>type=file</TT> case in <TT>INPUT</TT> is not handled.

</UL>

<DT>HTTP Protocol
<DD>Only the most used subset of HTTP/1.0 is implemented. Only the
<TT>GET</TT>, <TT>HEAD</TT> and <TT>POST</TT> methods are supported.
