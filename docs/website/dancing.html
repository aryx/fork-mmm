<H1>Dancing characters</H1>

I've looked the almost same applet in Java.
This applet has a serious bug.
Even if the page itself is lost, the applet is still running ...

<br>
<EMBED SRC="applets/dancing.ml" TYPE="application/x-caml-applet; encoding=source"
   FUNCTION="f" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200>
</EMBED>

Get the <A HREF="applets/dancing.ml">source</A>.
