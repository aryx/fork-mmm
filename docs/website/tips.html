<H2 align=left>Optimal use of the tachymeter</H2>
If you usually do long Web browsing sessions with a single instance of the
browser, then proceed as follows:
Resize the initial window to that only the tachymeter remains visible (80x80
is the nominal size, or better, run <TT>mmm</TT> with the option
<TT>-geometry 80x80+X+Y</TT> (where X and Y give the initial position).
Then, make this window <EM>Sticky</EM> in your window manager, so
that it remains visible in all your virtual screens. You can now
open windows by clicking with mouse button 1 in the tachymeter.
You can also select a URL in any window using the mouse, and the click with
button 2 on the tachymeter to open a new <B>MMM</B> window on the document
at this address.

<UL>
<LI> The document title is a menu : it displays the headers of the
document. Some headers are active (e.g. Refresh).
<LI> To search for text, type <TT>Control-S</TT>. This works in HTML
display windows (but incorrectly in the presence of tables and frames), and
in the source windows as well.
<LI> The dialog box for selecting a file name (e.g. when saving) has an
<EM>electric</EM> mode. If the mouse cursor is in one of the lists, you can
type caracters for faster moving around the list.
<LI> When you save to a file, if the first character of the file name is a
pipe (|), then the name is used as a command and executed with the document
as standard input.
