<H2 align=left>Hypertext links and active objects</H2>
<A NAME="nav"></A>
In an HTML document, hypertext links (or <EM>anchors</EM>) are usually
displayed in blue and underlined. The author of the document may have
specified a different color, but in any case:
<UL>
<LI> the mouse cursor becomes a "hand"
<LI> the destination address appears at the bottom of the window
</UL>

There are also active objects, like images; some are simple buttons, and
you can see the same feedback as for anchors in text. Others contain
different actives zones : the mouse cursor is then an arrow oriented to
the top and left. Either the image is not yet loaded, and then clicking
with button 1 will pop up a menu with the different possible links, or
the image is loaded, and it suffices to click at the appropriate zone.

<P>
There are several ways to activate an anchor, summarized below:

<DL compact>
<DT> Button-1
<DD> displays the document pointed to by this link in the same window,
except when specified otherwise by the document author (frames)

<DT> Shift + Button 1
<DD> save the document pointed to by this link (after asking a file name in
a dialog box)

<DT> Button 3
<DD> displays the document pointed to by this link in a new window

<DT> Control + Button 1
<DD> pops up a link activation menu, containing the above functionalities
and possible more

</DL>

The particular choice of mouse buttons and additionnal modifier keys 
is configurable by the user, by editing the preference file and
writing the adequate <A HREF="res.html">resources</A> 

<H2 align=left>Tool bar</H2>
The tool bar offers the following navigation buttons:
<DL compact>

<DT> Home
<DD> goes to the <B>Home</B> document, as defined <A HREF="cli.html#home">here</A>

<DT> Back
<DD> goes to the previous document (does not work with <EM>frames</EM>)

<DT> Forward
<DD> goes the next document (does not work with <EM>frames</EM>)
</DL>

These actions are also available from the <B>Navigation</B> menu,
and so is direct access to history navigation.
Menu shortchuts are configurable by <A HREF="res.html">resource
definitions</A> in the preference file.

<H2 align=left>Other interface elements</H2>
<H3>Reload, Update</H3>
<B>Reload</B> causes a complete reload of the document from its original
server, in particular asking the proxy not to consult its cache.

<P>
<B>Update</B> asks the server if the document has been modified since it has
been displayed in <B>MMM</B> (in particular, if <B>MMM</B> initially got
this document from the proxy's cache, this action checks with the server
if the document is up to date). Some servers do not know how to answer
this kind of requests (albeit defined in the HTTP/1.0 standard), and will
always return a new copy of the document, even if identical.

<H3>HTML Documents</H3>
<H4>Headers</H4>
The displayed title of the document is also a menu in which you can see
the HTTP headers of the document. Some headers are also active
(e.g. <TT>Refresh</TT>). 

<H4>Smooth scroll</H4>
The icon with two small arrows (as in scrollbars) changes the scroll mode
for this document. In the presence of large tables or images (e.g. whose
size is larger that <B>MMM</B>'s window size), scrolling doesn't work
properly and one must switch to <EM>smooth scroll</EM> to see the entire
contents of the document. This mode can be activated by default in the
<A HREF="prefs.html#html">preferences</A>, but is very costly.

<H4>Links</H4>
Right of this icon, the <B>Links</B> button, if active, pops up a menu
displaying additionnal links possibly specified in the document. If
<EM>frames</EM> were not activated, this menu contains in particular an
entry for each <EM>frame</EM> of the document.

<H4>Searching</H4>
Typing <TT>Control-S</TT> in the HTML display window pops up a dialog box
for searching text in the displayed document (search will <B>not</B> look
into <EM>table cells</EM> nor <EM>frames</EM>).

<H4>Progress report bar</H4>
At the bottom left part of the window, <B>MMM</B> displays a bar
reporting on the progress of retrieval of the required document. 
This bar becomes red if an error was detected during analysis and
display of the document (meaning then that the document may not be
properly displayed)

<H4>Source display</H4>
The <B>View Source</B> menu opens a window on the HTML source of the
document. This source may be annotated in colors (see <A
HREF="res.html#source">how</A>).
The locations of the errors are also displayed (<U>underlined</U>), and
the corresponding error message is displayed when the mouse cursor goes
over the error location. You can edit the source and redisplay the modified
version; also, if the document was accessed through a <TT>file:</TT> URL,
you can save the modified document at its location.
