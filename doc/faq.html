<H2 align=left>How do I pronounce MMM ?</H2>
<A NAME="pronounce"></A>
<B>MMM</B> should not be pronounced "three m", neither "m three", because
both are already related to existing products. "m m m", although sweet,
could induce some confusion.

The official pronounciation is thus
<A HREF="meuh.wav">this (WAV)</A> (or, in other audio formats
<A HREF="meuh.aiff">AIFF</A>,
<A HREF="meuh.au">ULAW</A>). However, in daily use, you might prefer
just "meuh" in french, that is "m" followed by a long "E", as in "burn".

<H2 align=left>My "backspace" key doesn't work</H2>
<A NAME="backspace"></A>
If this is the case, then your "backspace" key is in fact a
<TT>&lt;Delete&gt;</TT> key, or has been configured to behave as such
(check that with <TT>xev</TT>).
The obvious fix is to make your backspace key act as a real
<TT>&lt;BackSpace&gt;</TT> key. If you don't want to change your key, then
you'll have to use <TT>Control-h</TT>. Or you can edit a
<TT>$HOME/.camltkrc</TT> file, in which you'll put:
<PRE>
bind Entry &lt;Delete&gt; [bind Entry &lt;BackSpace&gt;]
bind Text &lt;Delete&gt; [bind Text &lt;BackSpace&gt;]
</PRE>
Then quit and run <B>MMM</B> again.

<H2 align=left>How to I type international characters (יטא...)</H2>
<A NAME="accents"></A>
International characters are supported by modern X11 servers through
the <EM>Compose</EM> function. On XFree86 (Linux and BSD), the default
binding uses the <TT>ScrollLock</TT> key. You can for example type
<PRE>
&lt;ScrollLock&gt; &lt;'&gt; &lt;e&gt; or &lt;ScrollLock&gt; &lt;e&gt; &lt;'&gt;
</PRE>
(that's three consecutive keypresses, unlike other modifiers such as
<TT>Alt</TT> or <TT>Control</TT>) and it produces "י". It is possible to
bind the compose function on  another key, using <TT>xmodmap</TT>. For
example, suppose that some unused key on your keyboard has keycode 116, then
you would add
<PRE>
keycode 116 = Multi_key
</PRE>
in your xmodmap configuration file, or simply execute
<PRE>
$ xmodmap -e 'keycode 116 = Multi_key'
</PRE>
Use <TT>xev</TT> to determine free keys and their keycode.

<P>
Other X servers probably have similar features.

<H2 align=left>I don't see DVIs and PostScript</H2>
<A NAME="metamail"></A>
Check your <TT>~/.mailcap</TT> file. The default <TT>mailcap</TT> of the
<TT>metamail</TT> distribution is not convenient for Web browsing.
A convenient <TT>.mailcap</TT> should contain something like:
<PRE>
application/postscript; ghostview %s
application/x-dvi; xdvi %s
# And if you are in fun mode, assuming these tools are installed
image/*; xv %s
video/mpeg; mpeg_play %s
video/*; xanim %s
# Etc...
</PRE>

<H2 align=left>I don't see compressed (.gz, .Z files)</H2>
<A NAME="gunzip"></A>
MMM <B>requires</B> the existence of <TT>gunzip</TT> in your <TT>PATH</TT>.

<H2 align=left>Where is my hotlist ?</H2>
<A NAME="hotlist"></A>
<B>MMM</B> has no predefined notion of <EM>hotlist</EM>, but supports
external hotlist managers. When you click on the <TT>To Hotlist</TT> button,
<B>MMM</B> invokes the hotlist manager as set in the <B>Preferences</B>.
See <A HREF="progs.html#hotlist">the examples</A>.

<H2 align=left>Why can't I read news with mmm ?</H2>
<A NAME="readnews"></A>
Use a real newsreader.

<H2 align=left>How do I connect MMM with my newsreader ?</H2>
<A NAME="fromnews"></A>
For GNUS 5, add the following in your <TT>.emacs</TT>
<PRE>
; Connecting GNUS and MMM (copied on the Grail version)
(defun mmm:send-url-to-mmm (url)
  (message "Sending URL to MMM...")
  (save-excursion
    (set-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Shell Command Output*"))
    (erase-buffer)
    ;; don't worry about this failing...
    (call-process "mmm_remote" nil 0 nil url)
    (message "Sending URL to MMM... done")))

(setq gnus-button-url 'mmm:send-url-to-mmm)
</PRE>
Be sure to run <B>mmm</B> with the <TT>-external</TT> option.
Clicking on an highlighted URL with mouse button 2 will open a new 
navigator window displaying the document at this URL.

<H2 align=left>Isn't MMM a memory pig ?</H2>
<A NAME="pig"></A>
Hard to say. Caml has a garbage collector and many efforts have been made to
remove space leaks due to global tables (such as callbacks or in-memory
cache). Nevertheless, long sessions with image loading turned on tend to
make the MMM process grow beyond reason (&gt;15M). There is at least one
possible explanation: since our HTML display machine is not that fast, MMM
is keeping all history windows alive at the same time, so that back/forward
is simply a matter of popping a window. With this behaviour, it means that
Tk must have a lot of windows open at the same time, possibly with in-lined
images; and this represents lots of memory. When the windows get killed, the
memory is freed. But then, on old Unix systems, the size of the process never
decreases. 
<P>
Since version 0.40, you can set a limit to the number of windows kept in
the <EM>widget cache</EM>, in order to limit the process size.

<H2 align=left><A NAME="pig2">Why is table display so lousy ?</A></H2>
<B>MMM</B> does not perform any layout computation based on font sizes,
margins, image sizes, etc... The HTML display machines only uses the
highest-level features of Tk's Text widget. In some cases, this pushes
Tk far beyond its limits. Moreover, many HTML documents are not well-formed,
and the error recovery strategy can not be expected to read the page
authors' mind.

<H2 align=left>Why is there only one tachymeter ?</H2>
<A NAME="tachymeter"></A>
It's simpler to manage for me.
