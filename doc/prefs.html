<H1>Preferences</H1>

<H2 align=left>Preferences files</H2>
<B>MMM</B> uses two preferences files : the first one is common to
all users of a system, and provides essentially a minimum common setup.
The second one is personal : it is modified by the user, either with
the preference control panels, or by hand-editing the file.

<H2 align=left>Preference panels</H2>
Preference panels are obtained by activating the <B>Preferences</B> menu.
The left part selects the panel for a given family of settings. The right
part shows the settings of a family.

<P>
The modification of a setting is active immediately, but does not
necessarily apply retro-actively to already existing windows.

<P>
To save the preferences for further sessions, use the <B>Save</B> button. To
revert to previously saved preferences, use the <B>Reset</B> button. To
change the preference file, use the menu.

<H2 align=left><A NAME="protocols">1- Protocols</A></H2>
<DL>
<DT> Proxy host
<DT> Proxy port
<DD> Defines the Web proxy to contact for all protocols that <B>MMM</B> does
not implement (<TT>ftp</TT>,<TT>wais</TT>,<TT>gopher</TT>,...), as well as
for accessing unreachable machines (e.g. because of firewall restrictions)).


<DT> Always use proxy
<DD> If this setting is active, <B>MMM</B> never tries a direct connection
to a server. This mode should be used on a slow network (e.g. PPP dialup).
In general, if you have access to a caching proxy, then you should activate
this setting. 

<DT> HTTP Send Referer
<DD> The HTTP protocol specifies that the browser can indicate in a request
to a server the context of this request (e.g. the document containing
the anchor on which we clicked). This is useful for the webmasters of the
sites you browser, because they can determine what servers point to her
their site, trace dangling links, ...) but it's also a privacy violation.
<B>MMM</B> will send this so-called <TT>Referer</TT> information <B>only</B>
if this setting is active.

<DT> User Agent
<DD> The browser name given by <B>MMM</B> when connecting to a server.

<DT> Timeout on headers (seconds)
<DD> Defines how much time we should wait for the beginning of an answer
before wondering if we should really continue. After this time is elapsed
(and if nothing was received), a dialog box offers the choice to:
<UL>
<LI> Retry (for again this amout of time)
<LI> Ignore (retry with no time limit, waiting either for a connection
shutdown or for the document to be received)
<LI> Abort (abort the request)
</UL>

<DT> Password lifetime (minutes)
<DD> Passwords used to connect to private sites have a limited lifetime.

<DT> Password save file
<DD> (not used)

<DT> Local binaries path
<DD> A colon(:) separated list of directories. When you ask for a document
at a <TT>file:</TT> address, which path is included in one of these
directories, <B>MMM</B> will execute this file as a CGI instead of
attempting to display the file (see the CGI protocol for more details; this
is the <EM>non-parsed-headers</EM> mode of CGI, meaning that the program
must produce a complete HTTP answer with status and headers). This is a trivial
example of such a program:
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
echo "HTTP/1.0 200 Found"
echo "Content-Type: text/html"
echo
cat << EOF
... some valid HTML ...
EOF
</PRE>
</DL>

<H2 align=left><A NAME="html">2- HTML parsing and display</A></H2>
<DL>
<DT> DTD
<DD> <B>MMM</B> knows several HTML DTDs. You can choose the one used to
parse HTML documents.

<DT> Strict HTML lexing
<DD> The lexical analysis implements some error recovery to attempt to
display incorrect documents reasonably. If this setting is active, no
error recovery takes place. For example, a tag with the attribute
<TT>ADD_DATE</TT> will be flagged as an error because the <TT>_</TT>
character is illegal in attribute names.

<DT> Attempt tables
<DD> Activates the display of tables. Otherwise, tables are displayed
similarly to &lt;DL&gt;, &lt;DT&gt;, &lt;DT&gt;.


<DT> Ignore relative TD width
<DD> Since a last minute change in the HTML 3.2 specifications, it has
become illegal to specify the width of a table cell (&lt;TD&gt;) as a
percentage. Moreover the interpretation of this quantity (percentage of
what ?) differs among authors and browsers. You'd better keep this
setting active, meaning that percentage width in table cell is ignored.

<DT> Attempt smooth scroll
<DD> Activates the "smooth scroll" mode (a defect in Tk makes scrolling
unusable when large images or tables are included in a document). This
mode is costly : you should rather use the "smooth scroll" button
(two arrows icon) to change scrolling mode individually for documents
where normal scroll doesn't work.

<DT> Frames as links
<DD> If this setting is active, <B>MMM</B> does not render frames,
but adds in the <B>Links</B> menu an entry for each frame of the document.
Otherwise, <EM>frames</EM> are rendered.

<DT> Background color
<DD> Unless otherwise specified by a document's author, this is the
background color (you should really put "white" here).

<DT> Entry and Textarea color
<DD> Background color of text entries in forms.

<DT> Follow document colors
<DD> Indicates if <B>MMM</B> should follow the color indications given by
authors. It may be useful to activate this settings to spare your eyes,
or simply because the document is unreadable otherwise.

<DT> Font choices
<DD> For each font, you may select the family, size in pixels, and other
settings. In the case of <B>Bold</B>, <TT>Italic</TT> and <TT>Fixed</TT>, 
the settings only define a <B>modification</B> of the current font (so, in
particular, you should not specify a size). In the case of <TT>Fixed</TT>,
the font <B>should</B> be a fixed font (same width for all characters).
</DL>

<H2 align=left><A NAME="images">3- Images</A></H2>
<DL>
<DT> No images at all
<DD> If this setting is active, no in-lined image will be loaded. Otherwise,
one of the image loading modes is used.

<DT> Image loading
<DD> Defines the image loading mode.
<DL>
<DT> After document, manual
<DD> Images are not loaded with the document. You must explicitly invoke
image loading through the menu, or select a particular image with
<TT>Control + Button 1</TT>. However, images already present in the cache
may still be displayed automatically since they don't involved network transfer.

<DT> After document, automatic
<DD> Images will be loaded and displayed automatically, as soon as the
document itself has been displayed.

<DT> During document loading
<DD> Images will be loaded and displayed as soon as they are encountered
in the document.
</DL>

<DT> Max image connections
<DD> Defines the maximum number of simultaneous network connections
dedicated to image loading. When this number is reached, requests for image
loading are queued are dealt with so as to respect the limit.

<DT> Max image connections (same host)
<DD> Defines the maximum number of simultaneous network connections
dedicated to image loading on a given site. In order to save bandwith,
this value should be either 2 or 3. When this number is reached, 
requests for image loading <B>on this site</B> are queued are dealt with so
as to respect the limit. For other sites, the other limit applies.

<DT> Gamma correction
<DD> Corrective factor for image brightness. Use a value greater than 1 to
make images brighter.

<DT> JPEG converter
<DD> Tk does not know how to load JPEG images, so we need an external
converter. This converter (<TT>djpeg</TT> by default) is called with 
an argument (file containing the image), and must produce an image
understandable by Tk (e.g. GIF or PNM) on its standard output.
</DL>

<H2 align=left><A NAME="progs">4- External programs</A></H2>
<DL>
<DT> Mailto program
<DD> Defines the name of the program to execute when the user actiaves a
<TT>mailto:</TT> link. If not specified, <B>MMM</B> opens a simple window
for composing the message, and uses the standard Unix <TT>mail</TT> command
to deliver it. Otherwise, the program is executed : it is responsible both
for message composition <B>and</B> delivery (check the <A
HREF="progs.html#mail">examples</A>).


<DT> Hotlist program
<DD> <B>MMM</B> does not provide a builtin hotlist or bookmarks system. You
have to use an external program for this purpose (check the <A
HREF="progs.html#hotlist">examples</A>). 


<DT> Printing program
<DD> <B>MMM</B> does not implement document printing. You have to use an
external program for this purpose (check the <A
HREF="progs.html#printing">examples</A>).
</DL>

<H3>External program definitions</H3>
In all these settings, you can provide an arbitrary shell command, and not
simply the name of a program. In each case, the invocation of this command
will involve a substitution of variables in this command. The variables
defined for each of these commands are:
<DL>
<DT> Mailto program
<DD> <DL compact>
<DT> <TT>$TO</TT>
<DD> destination address
<DT> <TT>$SUBJECT</TT>
<DD> message subject
</DL>

<DT> Hotlist program
<DD> <DL compact>
<DT> <TT>$URL</TT>
<DD> document url
<DT> <TT>$TITLE</TT>
<DD> document title (or URL if the document does not provide a title)
</DL>


<DT> Printing program
The program receives the content of the document on its standard input.
<DD> <DL compact>
<DT> <TT>$URL</TT>
<DD> document url
</DL>

</DL>


<H2 align=left><A NAME="cache">5- Cache settings</A></H2>

<B>MMM</B> keeps in a cache the more recently seen documents, up to a given limit.
<DL>
<DT> Max number of documents
<DD> Defines the maximum number of documents kept in the cache

<DT> Delete how much when full
<DD> Defines how many documents should be removed from the cache when it
gets full

<DT> Keep only history
<DD> If this setting is active, the cache only keeps the documents
currently in the history of one of <B>MMM</B>'s windows. When you close
a window, its documents are removed from the cache (except if they are
present in the history of another window). This setting should be used
only of you have a good bandwidth with your cacheing proxy.

<DT> Max cached widgets per window
<DD> Defines the number of documents for which <B>MMM</B> should keep
the graphical version in memory. If this value is large, navigation
in history is fast, but <B>MMM</B> occupies more memory. The lowest
value is 1, meaning that only the currently displayed document is 
kept in memory in graphical form.

</DL>

<H2 align=left><A NAME="applets">6- Applets</A></H2>

<H2 align=left><A NAME="misc">7- Misc. settings</A></H2>
<DL>
<DT> Use balloon helps
<DD> Self explanatory.

<DT> Use GIF animation
<DD> Self explanatory.

<DT> Automatic GIF animation display
<DD> If this setting is active, the animations are started
automatically. Otherwise, you must use button 2 on each animation to start
it. An image animated whenever the mouse cursor turns to a watch.
</DL>

<H2 align=left><A NAME="internal">8- Internal settings and debugging</A></H2>
These settings are not documented and should not be modified.
